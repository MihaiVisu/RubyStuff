This is a game engine simulating the old-school Gothons from Planet Percal game. It was done using ruby from scratch.

I have created this game and put it in the RubyStuff folder in order to practise with Classes and Class properties in Ruby.

To run it, just run classes.rb from the terminal using ruby compiler.

I will work for a more complicated version and load it on a webpage...
